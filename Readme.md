# Multi-agent simulation of a Traffic intersection 

### My contribution - Front end dev: Sebastian Rojas Salazar 
This was a group project for my Computer Graphics course. The project consisted on a python multi-agent system that simulates a traffic intersection where the cars and traffic lights were agents and given some inputs would simulate
how an interseciton worked. I worked on the whole unity project as well as managed the assests used and translated the 2D python simulation to a 3D environment in unity. 
In the unity environment the cars move by requesting the positions of the agents to a local server which gets the data from the python simulation.

Technologies Used
---------------
### Programming Languages
- Python
- C#

### Technologies
- Unity engine
- Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries
- Agent Py

How to run
---------------
In order to run the simulation you need to open the unity package, open the unity scene with the simulation, start the python server and then run the jupyter notebook and subsequently run the scene.
