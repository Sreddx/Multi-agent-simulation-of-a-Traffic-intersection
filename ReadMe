Front end dev: Sebastian Rojas Salazar 

This was a group project for the Computer Graphics course I on November 2021. My team worked on the Python simulation while I worked on the front end display in Unity.
I was also involved on some parts of the python script and the set up of the server.

This project is a simulation of a traffic intersection based on a multi agent system created with python and the AgentPy.
The front end of the simulation was made in the Unity Engine. The project includes the scene of the intersection, some assets and the c# scripts that 
translate the 2D simulation to the 3D unity environment. 
In the unity environment the cars move by requesting the positions of the agents to a local server which gets the data from the python simulation.
I worked on the whole front end part of the simulation. This includes the c# scripts, the unity project setup and the connection to the server.
Languages used: C# and Python.
Technologies: AgentPy, Unity Engine.
