Sebastian Rojas Salazar - 
This project is a simulation of a traffic intersection by creating a multi agent system with python. It was made by using the AgentPy library.
The front end of the simulation was made in the Unity Engine.
In the unity project the cars move by requesting the positions of the agentsto a local server which gets the data from the python simulation.
I focused on the logic and behaviour of the front end part of the simulation. These includes the c# scripts and the unity project setup and configuration. 
Languages used: C# and Python.
Technologies: AgentPy, Unity Engine.
