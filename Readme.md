# Multi-agent system of a Traffic intersection simulation
This mobile application was created in order to help the BAMX(Food bank of Mexico) increase the amount of donations that people made by creating a feed with the banks achieviements as well as relevant information of goals, places people could directly donate food as well as google maps and paypal integrations. 

### My contribution - Front end dev: Sebastian Rojas Salazar 
This was a group project for my Computer Graphics course. The project consisted on a python multi-agent system that simulates a traffic intersection where the cars and traffic lights were agents and given some inputs would simulate
how an interseciton worked. I worked on the whole unity project as well as managed the assests used and translated the 2D python simulation to a 3D environment in unity. 
In the unity environment the cars move by requesting the positions of the agents to a local server which gets the data from the python simulation.
